# Advanced-House-Price-Prediction
Predicting house prices using Linear Regression

# Usage
The notebook include all markdowns which explains the process.

The project is divided into three parts

# 1. EDA
I have done the exploratory data analysis including following steps.

- Missing Values (Here we'll only detect the missing values an
d in "FE we'll handle the missing values")
- All the numerical variables
- Distribution of numerical variables (if skewed, we need to d
o transformation)
- Categorical variables
- Cardinality of categorical variables (No. of unique values i
n a particular column)
- Outliers
- Relationship between Independent and dependent features(Sale
Price


# 2.Feature Engineering:
- To handle Missing Values w.r.t Numeric variables and Categoric variables
- To handle Temporal Variables (Year Variables)
- Categorical Variables: remove rare labels
- Standardize the values of variables to the same range


# 3.Feature Selection and Model Building:
- Train Test Split
- Feature Selection (Applying LassoRegression and SelectFromModel)
- Linear Regression Algorithm
